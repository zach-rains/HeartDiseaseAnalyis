# Heart Disease Analysis

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL**: Querying and transforming raw data.
- **Excel**: Summarizing and visualizing results.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data querying and aggregation with SQL.
- Data cleaning and preparation for analysis.
- Deriving actionable insights from raw data.
- Presentation of results in a clear, concise format.

## Repository Structure
- **SQL Files**: Located in the root directory and named descriptively.
- **Results Files**: Corresponding `.csv` files containing query outputs.
- **Cleaned Dataset**: Processed file ready for analysis.

## Future Work
- Enhance visual storytelling with Power BI dashboards.
- Expand analyses to include Python scripts for advanced statistical techniques.

### **Heart Disease Dataset Cleaning**
- **Cleaned Dataset**: [`heart_disease_cleaned.csv`](./heart_disease_cleaned.csv)
- **Description**: This dataset has been cleaned and prepared for further analysis, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and usability.

- **Description**: This project explores cholesterol trends by age group and gender, providing insights into population health metrics.

### 3. **Impact of Exercise on Health Metrics**
- **SQL Query**: [`ExerciseImpact.sql`](./ExerciseImpact.sql)
- **Results**: [`ExerciseImpactResult.csv`](./ExerciseImpactResult.csv)
- **Visualization**: ![Visualization](./Exercise_Impact.png)
- **Description**: Analyzes the correlation between exercise frequency and key health indicators such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and BMI.

### 4. **Comorbidities Correlation Analysis**
- **SQL Query**: [`Comorbidities_Correlation.sql`](./Comorbidities_Correlation.sql)
- **Results**: [`Comorbidities_Correlation_Results.csv`](./Comorbidities_Correlation_Results.csv)
- **Visualization**: ![Vizualization](./Comorbidities_Correlation.png)
- - **Description**: This project investigates correlations between various comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol) and their collective impact on health outcomes. It provides insights into how these conditions coexist and influence each other, helping to identify critical areas for public health intervention.
